                     Hey, I just want you to know how much you mean to me. You make every moment brighter and every day feel special. Iâ€™m lucky to have you in my life, and Iâ€™ll always cherish the moments we share. Thank you for being you, for being amazing and gorgeous, and for just being here.

                     First of all, those songs nga naas pikas file kay dedicated to you because I'd still choose you everyday, and from what I can tell is that you're an independent gurlie (sometimes), and the last song is that wa jud ko ga expect na maibog ko nimo when we first met because at the time I still have feelings for that other person, and wala koy pake sa uban tawo sauna kay lagi, nonchalant rajud kaayog linihokan. Never knew that pwede diay maka import ug Spotify link diris HTML.

                     I know we usually don't talk anymore like we used to before I confessed my feelings to you, but everytime we talk makes my heart flatter. Just remember that I'll always support you in literally anything and make you happy at all times.

                     <br/>
                     <br/>

                     Letâ€™s hang out sometime. You and me, talking and laughing about literally anything or we can sit in silence and watch the sunset while enjoying the moment together.

                     <br/>
                     <br/>

                     See you again next year. ðŸ˜Š
